//! Observability algorithms for runtime analysis and impact estimation.
//!
//! This module provides algorithms for analyzing runtime behavior and estimating
//! the impact radius of changes or failures in graph-structured systems.
//!
//! # Available Algorithms
//!
//! ## Runtime Event Analysis
//!
//! - [`happens_before_analysis`] - Analyze trace events for concurrent memory access pairs
//! - [`VectorClock`] - Partial order data structure for event ordering
//! - [`HappensBeforeResult`] - Result with concurrent pairs and statistics
//! - [`TraceEvent`] - Runtime event representation (Read/Write operations)
//!
//! ## Impact Analysis
//!
//! - [`impact_radius`] - Compute blast zone using bounded reachability with edge weights
//! - [`impact_radius_with_progress`] - Impact radius with progress tracking
//! - [`ImpactRadiusConfig`] - Configuration for impact radius (max_distance, max_hops, weight_fn)
//! - [`ImpactRadiusResult`] - Result with blast_zone, distances, boundary, size
//! - [`WeightCallback`] - Weight callback type for edge-weighted analysis
//! - [`default_weight_fn`] - Default weight function returning 1.0 for all edges
//!
//! # When to Use Happens-Before Analysis
//!
//! ## Race Detection
//! - **Data race detection** - Identify unsynchronized concurrent memory accesses
//! - **Lock validation** - Verify synchronization primitives are used correctly
//! - **Memory model testing** - Validate concurrent program behavior
//!
//! ## Event Ordering
//! - **Causal ordering** - Determine if one event must precede another
//! - **Concurrency detection** - Find events that are not causally related
//! - **Trace debugging** - Understand execution order in concurrent systems
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! Vector clocks implement a partial order on events in distributed/concurrent systems:
//!
//! 1. **Vector Clock Comparison** - For events A and B:
//!    - A happens-before B if A's clock <= B's clock element-wise, with at least one <
//!    - A is concurrent with B if neither happens-before the other
//!    - A == B if all clock elements are equal
//!
//! 2. **Clock Operations**:
//!    - `increment(thread_id)` - Increment clock for current thread
//!    - `merge(other)` - Take element-wise max with another clock (after synchronization)
//!    - `happens_before(other)` - Check if this clock precedes other
//!    - `is_concurrent(other)` - Check if clocks are unrelated
//!
//! 3. **Race Detection**:
//!    - Group events by memory location
//!    - For each location, compare vector clocks of all access pairs
//!    - Concurrent accesses to same location = potential data race
//!
//! # Complexity
//!
//! - **Time**: O(E * L) where E = events, L = accesses per location
//! - **Space**: O(E) for storing events grouped by location
//!
//! Where:
//! - E = number of trace events
//! - L = maximum number of accesses to any single location
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use sqlitegraph::algo::observability::{
//!     happens_before_analysis, TraceEvent, Operation, VectorClock,
//! };
//!
//! // Create trace events from concurrent execution
//! let mut events = vec![
//!     // Thread 1 writes to location 100
//!     TraceEvent {
//!         event_id: 1,
//!         thread_id: 1,
//!         operation: Operation::Write,
//!         memory_location: 100,
//!         vector_clock: VectorClock::new().incremented(1),
//!     },
//!     // Thread 2 writes to location 100 (concurrent!)
//!     TraceEvent {
//!         event_id: 2,
//!         thread_id: 2,
//!         operation: Operation::Write,
//!         memory_location: 100,
//!         vector_clock: VectorClock::new().incremented(2),
//!     },
//! ];
//!
//! let result = happens_before_analysis(&events)?;
//!
//! println!("Detected {} potential data races", result.concurrent_pairs.len());
//! for (event_a, event_b) in &result.concurrent_pairs {
//!     println!("  Race: thread {} vs thread {} on location {}",
//!         event_a.thread_id, event_b.thread_id, event_a.memory_location);
//! }
//! ```

///
/// # Complexity
///
/// - **Time**: O(|V| + |E|) within the blast zone

///
/// # Edge Cases
///
/// - **Empty graph**: Returns {source} with distance 0.0
/// - **Source not in graph**: Returns {source} with distance 0.0
/// - **Disconnected**: Only reaches nodes in source's component
