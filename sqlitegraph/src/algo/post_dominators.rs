//! Post-dominator computation using virtual graph reversal and Cooper et al. algorithm.
//!
//! This module provides algorithms for computing post-dominators and immediate post-dominators
//! in control flow graphs (CFGs). Post-dominance is the dual of dominance: instead of asking
//! "what nodes must we pass through to reach this node from entry?", post-dominance asks
//! "what nodes must we pass through to reach exit from this node?"
//!
//! # Post-Dominance Definition
//!
//! A node `d` **post-dominates** node `n` (written `d pdom n`) if every path from `n` to
//! an exit node must pass through `d`. Every node post-dominates itself, and exit nodes
//! post-dominate all nodes that can reach them.
//!
//! The **immediate post-dominator** of a node `n` (written `ipdom(n)`) is the unique strict
//! post-dominator of `n` that is closest to `n` in the CFG. If we think of post-dominance
//! as a tree, the immediate post-dominator is the parent of `n` in the post-dominator tree.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! This module computes post-dominators by **virtual graph reversal**:
//!
//! 1. **Virtual reversal**: Build predecessor map without modifying the graph
//! 2. **Reuse Cooper algorithm**: Apply same iterative solver as dominators, using predecessor map
//! 3. **Multiple exit handling**: Automatically unify multiple exits with virtual exit node
//! 4. **Iterative refinement**: Intersect successors' post-dominator sets until fixed point
//! 5. **Immediate post-dominator extraction**: Compute post-dominator tree from final sets
//!
//! This approach is elegant: post-dominators on original graph = dominators on reversed graph.
//! By using predecessor maps, we avoid the cost of actually reversing the graph.
//!
//! # Complexity
//!
//! - **Time**: O(N²) worst case, O(E) to O(N log N) in practice for typical CFGs
//! - **Space**: O(N²) for post-dominance sets, O(N) for immediate post-dominator tree
//!
//! Where:
//! - N = number of vertices
//! - E = number of edges
//!
//! The algorithm performs identically to dominators because it's the same computation
//! on a virtually reversed graph.
//!
//! # When to Use Post-Dominator Analysis
//!
//! ## Compiler Optimization
//!
//! - **Control dependence analysis**: Compute control dependence using post-dominance frontiers
//! - **Code motion**: Move code to post-dominator (safe placement point)
//! - **Loop exit optimization**: Identify loop exits and their post-dominance relationships
//! - **Dead code elimination**: Find code that cannot reach any exit
//!
//! ## Program Analysis
//!
//! - **Impact analysis**: Determine what a node affects (forward vs backward)
//! - **Slicing**: Compute backward slices using post-dominance
//! - **Data flow analysis**: Use post-dominance to prune constraints
//! - **Program understanding**: Analyze control flow from exits backward
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use sqlitegraph::{SqliteGraph, algo::post_dominators};
//!
//! let graph = SqliteGraph::open_in_memory()?;
//! // ... build CFG with exit node 3 ...
//!
//! let result = post_dominators(&graph, 3)?;
//!
//! // Check post-dominance: does 3 post-dominate 0?
//! let post_dominates = result.post_dom.get(&0)
//!     .map(|set| set.contains(&3))
//!     .unwrap_or(false);
//!
//! // Get immediate post-dominator of node 0
//! let ipdom = result.ipdom.get(&0); // Option<&Option<i64>>
//!
//! // Traverse post-dominator tree from exit
//! let mut current = Some(3);
//! while let Some(node) = current {
//!     println!("Node {} in post-dominator tree", node);
//!     // Find children by checking ipdom values
//!     current = /* ... */;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Multiple Exit Nodes
//!
//! CFGs with multiple exits are handled automatically:
//!
//! - **Single exit**: Use directly as exit node
//! - **Multiple exits**: Add virtual exit (id: -1) that all real exits point to
//! - **No exits**: Return error (degenerate CFG)
//!
//! The virtual exit node is only used internally - results only contain real nodes.
